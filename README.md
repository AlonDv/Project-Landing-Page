# Project-Landing-Page


A web page built to master the fundamentals of CSS Flexbox. This project focuses on structural alignment, container-to-child relationships, and clean HTML architecture.

## Project Goals
* Implement a multi-section layout using only Flexbox.
* Practice justify-content and align-items for precise centering.
* Maintain a clean, semantic HTML structure before adding styles.
* Experiment with flex-wrap for handling content flow.

## Built With
* HTML5 - Semantic markup.
* CSS3 - Custom properties and Flexbox layout module.
* VS Code - Primary code editor.

## Project Structure
1. Header: A navigation bar using justify-content: space-between.
2. Hero Section: A centered call-to-action using Flexbox alignment.
3. Feature Grid: A flexible row of cards using flex: 1.
4. Footer: Simple aligned links and copyright info.

## Learning Objectives
- Understanding the difference between the main axis and the cross axis.
- Building a layout block-by-block to avoid complex CSS issues later.
- Practicing the "parent-child" relationship central to Flexbox logic.
